First and foremost, congratulations to me for keeping my <em>post every day</em> commitment for one day. It's kinda like receiving a 24-hour chip at an AA meeting. Except in this case, I'm sobering up from the depressing materialist[ic] reality of a meaningless existence. Actually...that doesn't sound different.

Second, I just realized that my passion for money has followed a similar trend as my passion for <a href="http://www.seomofo.com">search engine optimization</a>--namely, a promising spike followed by a long downward spiral.

I know, I know...you're probably thinking:

> You can't get a spiral from a trend line!

Pfff...yeah, not with <strong>that</strong> attitude.

Anyway, my next thought was <em>what if I lose interest because I know that the rules of the game are entirely man-made</em>?

With SEO, I seem to have lost interest when I realized Google engineers are the gods of that realm. Similarly, with <em>money</em>, I seem to have lost interest when I realized the whole system is controlled by people (and isn't directly tied to natural resources). In either case, there's no real autonomy or independence there; I'd always be operating under <strong>artificial</strong> constraints. I'm not saying I should avoid these systems; I just think I need a more natural system by which to measure my success. Something like...I don't know...<em>what other people think of me</em>.

Wait...

Damn it.
