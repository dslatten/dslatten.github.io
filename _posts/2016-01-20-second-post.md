It's absolutely amazing how I can create a first post and tell myself something like:

> Remember to just keep writing, no matter what. It doesn't have to be perfect or insightful...it just has to exist. Anything is better than nothing. Just create something.

...and here we are, 20 days later, and I haven't written another post.

Hell, if I had committed to a post every day, I'd have 19 more posts. What would I have written about, I wonder?

Okay, that's it. I'm making that commitment. A new post every day. Starting now.
