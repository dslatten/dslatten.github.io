Today's post isn't inspired. I've been staring at my computer screen for like 20-30 minutes, waiting for a particular topic or thought to jump out and exclaim "hey, pick **me**!" but it hasn't happened. A couple of thoughts are limping around, mumbling unintelligible unintelligibilities, but I've got too much to do today and lack the patience to sit around hoping these duds evolve into winners. I'm out.
