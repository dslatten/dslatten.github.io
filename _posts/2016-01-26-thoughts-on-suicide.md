Yesterday was not my favorite day.

Yesterday sucked.

After I posted, I began the process of organizing my possessions into <strong>Keep</strong> and <strong>Not Keep</strong> piles. The <strong>Keep</strong> pile has to fit into a Toyota Corolla, so most of my time was spent building up the other, thinking things like "this will be gone soon."

It is actually much more difficult than I anticipated, even for the things I haven't used in a really long time.

> No! Not your Nintendo! Think about all the good times you've had with it! You're giving away your childhood!

Add to this the fact that I had been fasting (water only) for 2 days, and the result was a state of consciousness that resembled something like a lucid nightmare. I tried desperately to <strong>think</strong> my way out, but it was like trying to stop a battalion of fear, using nothing but my official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot Range model air rifle of positive thinking.

The anxiety got so bad I went for a walk; tried to clear my head. While I was on that walk, I got a phone call: my roommate's brother committed suicide.

To fully appreciate how hard this news hit me, there are some things you should know. First, my roommate is one of my dearest friends--we were friends long before we were roommates. Second, my roommate's brother was extremely intelligent. Third, I also have an extremely intelligent brother, and one of my greatest fears is that he'll kill himself. And lastly, <strong>I'm</strong> extremely intelligent, and fairly recently, I've talked openly to my roommate about killing myself.

So...yeah. I returned home. Suffice it to say my lucid nightmare reached new depths of pain that made <em>selling my possessions</em> feel like a Disney vacation by comparison.

Today I've been thinking about it. I can't help but wonder how common it is for extremely intelligent people to end their lives. I also wonder if they do so for fundamentally different reasons. For example, is there a difference between people who think <em>the game of life is too hard and I'll never win</em> versus those who think <em>the game of life is stupid and pointless; I don't want to play</em>?

It seems common to assume that suicide is an irrational behavior, but I'm not convinced that's always the case.

I read an article about <a href="http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10554.aspx">existential depression in gifted adults</a>, and it was suprisingly helpful for me personally.

I had more thoughts on the matter, but I just ate for the first time in 60 hours and I'm slipping into a sugar coma. Gonna go lie down for a bit.
