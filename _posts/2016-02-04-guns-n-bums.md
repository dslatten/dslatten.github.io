Today was fairly busy, at least by my standards. I actually got in my car and drove somewhere, so...you know...right off the bat, we're talkin' **extreme levels of productivity**.

I went to the local pawn shop and sold a shotgun and an air rifle for $163. Despite all the imagined scenarios of hunting small animals for food or surviving a zombie apocolypse, the fact of the matter is those guns have done nothing but take up closet space and make roommates nervous. I can still imagine the survival scenarios...only now I'm throwin' rocks and hitting things with a stick.

After that, I went to the gas station and cashed in 2 scratch-off lottery tickets I've had sitting on my desk for like a year. I put the $30 toward a tank of gas and a case of bottled water. My change was $1.

Then I went to Lowe's and returned a heat gun I never used, then to the car place to ask why my Check Engine light is on (answer: gas cap wasn't capping gas).

Finally I started to head home. While waiting at a stoplight, I noticed a homeless woman walking along with a sign that read "Please help. God Bless." and I would have given her some money, but I wasn't in the appropriate lane. And my driver-side window doesn't roll down, so I would have had to get out, run across the inside traffic lane, and hand her the cash. I didn't know when the light was going to turn green, so instead **I imagined what it would be like** to get out, run across the inside traffic lane, and hand her the cash. Turns out there was plenty of time, because I imagined the full sequence like 6 times.

The light eventually turned green and I drove away, mildly disappointed in myself for letting that hypothetical green light situation get the best of me. But it wasn't too late. I could totally redeem myself!

I drove down to the next underpass, turned around, drove back to the previous underpass, turned around, and this time I chose the inside lane. I opened my door and handed the woman $4 (leaving me with an even $160) and one of my bottled waters. Why the bottled water? Well, first of all, because it makes me feel just a tiny bit more thoughtful than if it were just money. Maybe I'm deluding myself, but I feel like the water added a touch of class to the exchange. Like I was saying *"hey, humans need water and you're a human and I'm a human and we're both just humans so let's share this water."* 

Second of all, the less money she has to spend on essentials like water, the more money she'll have for drugs and alcohol.
