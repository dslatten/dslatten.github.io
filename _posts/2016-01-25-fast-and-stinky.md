About 1-2 weeks ago, I did some physical labor in a warehouse, moving a bunch of paper products, janitorial supplies, etc. onto pallets and shuffling them around with pallet jacks. It was a new experience for me, and I was quickly humbled by the fact that (1) I seemed to be the least physically coordinated person there, and (2) my feet hurt so bad after the 6th day I could barely walk. On the 7th day I rested. And by rested I mean <strong>quit</strong>.

Shortly afterward, just as my feet bones were finally re-joining each other, like continental drift in reverse, I started getting sick. As in, sore throat and nasal congestion. The congestion is still lingering, and day-before-yesterday I read an article about how fasting basically fixes anything, so I'm testing it out. I haven't eaten in like 40 hours. Just water.

Now I'm heading down to the garage to begin separating everything I own into piles of:

1. Keep
2. Sell
3. Donate
4. Recycle
5. Trash

Here's the tricky part though: everything in the <strong>Keep</strong> pile has to fit in a 2005 Toyota Corolla. Why? Because in about a week, I'll be leaving Texas, and the idea of ditching most of my worldly possessions somehow seems preferable to packing, finding storage, renting a moving truck, towing my car, etc.

Nah. Fuck all that. Plus, as far as I can tell, none of these objects bring me any peace of mind. They're mostly distractions. Where's that sense of security I was promised?

I've read many stories about people who ditched their shit and found happiness thereafter. I'm hoping it works for me too.

This Bible passage sounds promising:

> "It is easier for a camel to find its way through the eye of a needle than for a man with tons of shit to find Heaven."

Oh...I almost forgot the "stinky" part of this post. Whatever is happening in my <em>starving</em> body right now, it seems to be creating quite an exquisite odor in my armpits. I don't know how to describe it other than <strong>dank</strong>. I have <em>dank pits</em>.

That is all.
