One of the things I've noticed lately is how vastly different the effects of cannabis can be, depending on my baseline mental state. My "rational" assumption would be that if I consume the same substance, in the same amount, I can expect the same result. But from what I've observed, that assumption isn't true. Cannabis seems more like a box of chocolates. Or Russian Roulette. Or a box of Russians.
