Why do I behave the way I do? What are the <em>assumptions</em> that form the base of my <em>logical conclusions</em>? When someone reads my writing or observes my behavior and says "OMG, Darren, you're batshit-fucking-crazy, yo!", what can I point to that will allow them to understand that I'm actually quite reasonable--I just operate on a different set of beliefs?

A person's beliefs are incredibly powerful. <strong>People kill and are willing to die for their beliefs.</strong> With stakes that high, maybe we should all take the time to write down our beliefs and try to understand them better? Just sayin'. 

# 1. Humans are fallible

No one knows absolute truth. We can only know an <em>approximation</em> of truth, based on our assumptions and experience. Therefore, it is critical to understand that my beliefs are not perfect, nor will they ever be. In fact, no one's beliefs will ever be perfect. There are no <em>safe assumptions</em>. There are no facts beyond contestation. Even if the entire human race believes something, that still doesn't guarantee that it's true. On the contrary, the easiest way to <strong>guarantee that you're wrong</strong> is to refuse to question/update your beliefs, even when new information is presented. As soon as you say "That's it. I know all there is to know. I'm not changing my beliefs ever again." that's when you limit yourself.
