Why do I behave the way I do? What are the <em>assumptions</em> that form the base of my <em>logical conclusions</em>? When someone reads my writing or observes my behavior and says "OMG, Darren, you're batshit-fucking-crazy, yo!", what can I point to that will allow them to understand that I'm actually quite reasonable--I just operate on a different set of beliefs?

A person's beliefs are incredibly powerful. <strong>People kill and are willing to die for their beliefs.</strong> With stakes that high, maybe we should all take the time to write down our beliefs and try to understand them better? Just sayin'. 

# 1. Humans are fallible

No one knows absolute truth. We can only know an <em>approximation</em> of truth, based on our assumptions and experience. Therefore, it is critical to understand that my beliefs are not perfect, nor will they ever be. In fact, no one's beliefs will ever be perfect. There are no <em>safe assumptions</em>. There are no facts beyond contestation. Even if the entire human race believes something, that still doesn't guarantee that it's true. On the contrary, the easiest way to <strong>guarantee that you're wrong</strong> is to refuse to question/update your beliefs, even when new information is presented. As soon as you say "That's it. I know all there is to know. I'm not changing my beliefs ever again." that's when you limit yourself.

# 2. Experience trumps faith

This is pretty simple. Let's assume you do <strong>not</strong> believe in the existence of aliens. Now, which of the following is <strong>most likely to change your mind</strong>:

a. Your friends tell you aliens exist.
b. Your government tells you aliens exist.
c. You watch UFO videos on YouTube.
d. An alien lands a spacecraft on your lawn, walks inside your house, eats all your food, and never leaves--it just lives in your spare bedroom now and plays Xbox all day.
