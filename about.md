Everyone needs a purpose. Without a purpose, we have no reason to live. Then we get depressed and start asking questions like "What the fuck am I doing with my life?"

For me, I didn't have a clear answer. This website is my attempt to make sense of my reality, clarify my purpose, and find meaningful happiness.

Why do it online, in the public spotlight?

Because regardless of what happens, my story might be useful to others. If I find my happiness, it will be an inspirational story. If I fuck up and kill myself, it will be a cautionary tale. Either way, you win.
