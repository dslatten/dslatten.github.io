I've spent most of my life pursuing things that I assumed would make me happy: money, possessions, approval from others, etc. Yet beneath it all, I've never really felt peace. It feels like I've been living someone else's life. It feels like something is missing.

The purpose of this website is to help me understand myself, develop my sense of purpose, and unlock my true potential so that I can effectively help others and make a positive impact on this planet.
