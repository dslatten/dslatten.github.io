The primary purpose of this page is to provide an outline and description of the content classification system used throughout this website. A clearly defined content structure helps me organize my thoughts and reduces the *cognitive startup costs* that dissuade me from turning those thoughts into usable content. In other words, the primary purpose of this page is to answer the question:

> I have something to write (or data to record). Where and how should I create this content?

The secondary purpose is to provide an overview of various *post types*, which can potentially jump-start my creativity on days where I'm not feeling particularly inspired to write. In other words, the secondary purpose of this page is to answer the question:

> I want to create a new post, but I don't know what to write about. What are some options?

This doesn't exist yet, but I'm imagining this website becoming a sort of hub for all things *Darren Slatten*, which may include features that monitor food/supplement intake, exercise, mental health, etc.
